        <p class="faq-text">
            Metaverse is an umbrella term that can have many meanings depending
            on who and where you ask. Broadly speaking, metaverse refers to the
            digital worlds created by the convergence of multiple technologies
            and software interacting with one another. Although virtual reality
            and related features are often mentioned, metaverse can also refer
            to the wide assimilation of technology that augments and enhances
            our reality and lived experiences. The fact is, there are many
            ‘metaverse’ features in our lives already including from the
            smartphones we use to the smart electronics you may have in your
            home or professional environment.

        <p class="faq-text">
            Metaverse Education is the combination of the aforementioned
            technologies and software with education. It is a fusion of
            tradition teaching methodologies with modern technology to create
            enhanced learning experiences. The integration of technology and
            software within traditional schooling and learning is an example of
            metaverse education.

            SENSE offers a unique Minecraft and Google-based tutoring service as
            well as a secure, teacher moderated server for students to spend
            their time safely. The available lessons range from original SENSE
            content and/or textbook-based lessons created from the curriculum or
            learning objectives required by each client and their respective
            schools.

            So are students just playing games while studying?
        </p>
        <div class="faq-arrow" />
        <p class="faq-text">
            Active learning is the process of engaging students through
            discussion, problem solving, co- operation and project-based
            learning. At SENSE we believe that when students are actively
            involved in the learning process, the information is retained far
            more effectively. Think of it as trying to learn an idea by reading
            a book or visiting a lecture versus someone demonstrating and
            practicing that idea with you then using a tool so you can enjoy
            learning and recollect those ideas far easier.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-text">
            The games we use are merely a tool, the real learning occurs from
            the effective mixture of qualified teachers guiding and teaching
            students while using the SENSE platform to connect with students’
            interests while providing a captivating and exciting learning
            experience.

            option of custom curriculums or school-based curriculums so that
            students are able to transfer their valuable SENSE lessons into
            their school and/or exam preparation progress.

        <p class="faq-text">
            There are significant challenges and problems with online learning
            especially when applied en masse. With recent events, schools,
            parents and students witnessed how frustrating and
            counter-productive it can be to host a whole classroom online.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-text">
            SENSE addresses all these concerns by providing personalized and
            highly concentrated classes of one to four students at a maximum.
            Each lesson is guided by a qualified teacher who can easily manage
            one to four students while ensuring each one gets valuable and
            direct teaching attention. Parents and students can also request
            their preference for class sizes and students can be paired up for
            optimum learning on the SENSE server.

        <p class="faq-text">
            Aside from the vast amounts of research and data that show how
            certain games can improve both intelligence and memorization, SENSE
            creates an educational system that enables students to visualize and
            enhance their academic progress through the digital world. Students
            still receive traditional teaching and assessments from qualified
            teachers while seeing the results of their learning manifest in the
            digital world.
        </p>
        <p class="faq-text">
            As students’ progress in their SENSE lessons, their participation
            and engagement leads to increased opportunities to alter the world
            around them. Rather than having a disconnected relationship with
            education, students embody their learning by literally transforming
            their digital world the more they learn. SENSE enables students to
            witness and experience how their education gives them more tools,
            knowledge and ideas to creatively and literally change their world.

            With all SENSE M&amp;G Tutoring lessons, students are given access
            to the SENSE server for the duration of the lesson. However, should
            students wish to access and engage with the rewards and learning
            bonuses within the SENSE server, they are required to have a monthly
            subscription to the SENSE server. This subscription enables them to
            have access to SENSE Student Center and Survival Zone along with all
            the study and gameplay benefits allocated there. Students are
            required to have at least one SENSE lesson per month (or 30 day
            period) in order to maintain eligibility to subscribe to the SENSE
            server.
